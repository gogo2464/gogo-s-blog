As a first exercise, today we are going to dissect a stack buffer overflow worm present that exploits a vulnerabilty present on the video game pokemon red and blue on gameboy. We will use reverse engineering technics.
I choose to use gameboy because this architecture has no mitigation. It is a perfect example. Also the roms of gameboy are unpatchable. It is the definition of ROM: Read Only Memory.</description></item></channel></rss>
