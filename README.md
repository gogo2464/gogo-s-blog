## Blog of Gogo

I wrote a blog with a set of article `from 0 to buffer overflow` to teach exploitation to people. The blog is reachable at [this address](https://gogo2464.github.io/gogo-s-blog/post/).

The goal is to learn reverse engineering and binary exploitation only doing real projects instead of CTFs.
