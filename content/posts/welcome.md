Hi and welcome to my blog. I am going to talk about my hobbies for reverse engineering, exploitation and cryptanalysis. So let's define these words. Reverse engineering is the art/technic to understand and modify software or hardware that have not beem made to be open and modificated. This is only the technic. The objectives could vary a lot of and a lot. This could be for malware analysis, when an antivirus need to be updated by understanding how the malware works. This could be for weird motivations often related to hacking. Like when an hacker want to guess what is in the released game source code in order to imagine and leak secrets about what will be in the future versions of the game. This could be anbsolutely anything. If some software are not been made to be analyzed, some have even been made to try to resist to analysis. Then this is an endless fight between reverse-engineers and engineers. But the code is absolutely never ever impossible to read or to understand. This is fun because the DRM engineers want to make their code harder to read and so more enignmatics. But for me it is only more challenging then even more interesting and encourage me to continue... But still takes more time to analyze...

Exploitation is the art of writting exploits. It means small programs made to exploit a vulnerability on a specific software. Litteraly hack computers. I mostly do memory corruption attacks.

Cryptanalysis is a branch of the mathenmatics made to attack cryptography. Cryptography is math about to defend information. Cryptanalysis is about to attack, to break! It is from far deeper than just using cryptography.


In the blog "From 0 to buffer overflow" you will learn to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities from almost no knowledge. Except programming in python and C. Until you will able to make an usable attack on a modern and common computer.
